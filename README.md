# _Cocktail Party Order!_

#### Order a custom cocktail

#### By Brittany Gollins

## Description & Specs

This is a website that will take a cocktail order in 3 parts, and should provide the user with their end order as well as a price.

Specifications:
Create a website for a company where a user can choose one or more individual assets (ex. toppings on a pizza, garnishes for a drink) as well as another variable asset (ex. size of pizza, type of mixer for a drink) and see the final cost.

For the cocktail creator:
* Allow the user to choose liquor type, mixer, and garnishes/extras for the drink they'd like to order.
* Create a cocktail object constructor with properties for liquor and garnishes/extras.
* Create a prototype method for the cost of a cocktail depending on the selections chosen.

Objectives for passing:
* Code meets standards from previous weeks.
* Objects drive business logic (in JavaScript, not jQuery).
* Constructors and prototypes are used successfully.
* Application works as expected.
* Plain English specs are present in README.

## Known Bugs

_The page's jquery doesn't call on the business logic in order to create the price for the customer._

## Technologies Used
